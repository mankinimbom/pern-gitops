echo "======================================"

echo "Step 1: Watch GitHub Actions"
echo "- Go to: https://github.com/mankinimbom/pern-app/actions"
echo "- Look for 'CI/CD Pipeline' workflows"
echo "- Check that 'deploy-staging' and 'deploy-production' jobs complete"

echo ""
echo "Step 2: Monitor GitOps Repository Commits"
echo "- Repository: https://github.com/mankinimbom/pern-gitops/commits/main"
echo "- Look for commits like: 'üöÄ Deploy to staging: update images to [SHA]'"
echo "- Command: git log --oneline --grep='Deploy to' -5"

echo "Step 3: Check Image Tag Updates"
echo "- Staging: /home/sysadmin/pern/pern-gitops/apps/pern-app/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml"
echo "- Production: /home/sysadmin/pern/pern-gitops/apps/pern-app/overlays/production/kustomization.yaml"
echo "- Command: grep -A 4 'images:' apps/pern-app/overlays/*/kustomization.yaml"

echo ""
echo "Step 4: Trigger a Test Build"
echo "- Make a small change to your app (e.g., update README.md)"
echo "- Commit and push to main branch"
echo "- Watch GitHub Actions run the pipeline"
echo "- Verify new commit appears in pern-gitops with updated image tags"

echo "üìä CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY:"
echo "========================="
echo "‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow: WORKING"
echo "‚úÖ Image building and pushing: WORKING"  
echo "‚úÖ GitOps repository updates: WORKING"
echo "‚úÖ Image tag replacement in kustomization: WORKING"
echo "‚ùå ArgoCD sync to Kubernetes: NEEDS ATTENTION"
echo ""

echo "üéâ Your CI/CD pipeline IS updating images correctly!"
echo "The issue is with ArgoCD syncing, not with image updates."

echo "To see it in action:"
echo "1. Make a code change and push to GitHub"  
echo "2. Watch: https://github.com/mankinimbom/pern-app/actions"
echo "3. Check commits: https://github.com/mankinimbom/pern-gitops/commits/main"
echo "4. Run: ./monitor-image-updates.sh to see updated tags"
